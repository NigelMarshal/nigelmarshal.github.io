      "description": "At Ajar, a pioneering PropTech firm in the Middle East, I took the helm of front-end development to institute major platform overhauls and innovatively integrate new features. I completely reconstructed the landing pages using Angular and Bootstrap, which directly translated into a 30% uptick in user engagement. I optimized the login and sign-up processes, added robust features like expense management and report downloading, and revamped the leases management system. Furthermore, I championed the migration from Firebase APIs to REST APIs, improving backend data handling and overall platform responsiveness. As a testament to my adaptability, I seamlessly transitioned from React to Angular within a tight two-month window. In collaboration with marketing initiatives, I drove the implementation of Facebook and Snapchat tracking pixels, culminating in a notable 20% increase in high-value clients. By incorporating automated test cases using Playwright with GitHub workflows, I advanced the deployment process, ensuring faster release cycles, a heightened code quality, and a 35% reduction in bug resolution time. Throughout, I maintained the brand's graphic consistency and high-quality standards, further elevating the platform's user experience.",
