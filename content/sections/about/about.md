I am a **Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience** specializing in front-end development and user experience (UX). I graduated with distinction from Heriot-Watt University in Dubai, obtaining a **Bachelor of Science** in **Computer Systems**.

My journey began in the realm of **UX** at **rbbi**, a leading UX agency in the MENA region. From there, I expanded my horizons, joining **dubizzle** under the **OLX group**, where I became the pivotal front-end support for the OLX MENA region. My role spanned across eight countries, and I'm particularly proud of leading the rollout of paid ad subscription services, amplifying ad reach for OLX MENA users.

Most recently, I've been working at **Ajar**, where I've continued to deepen my expertise in **Angular** while contributing to the design and implementation of several key platform features. This has led to significant increases in user engagement and platform efficiency and helped in acquiring high-value clients.

Between these roles, I took a year to freelance, aiding small businesses in digital transformation. This endeavor sharpened my web development and content writing skills, keeping me synced with the evolving tech industry.

Armed with expertise in **React, Angular, HTML5, RxJS, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript** and more, I've also managed projects and led QA and User testing phases. My diverse experiences, from working with multicultural teams to handling diverse tech stacks, have shaped me into a versatile and adaptive professional.

I'm fueled by continuous learning, always eager to assimilate emerging skills and technologies.
