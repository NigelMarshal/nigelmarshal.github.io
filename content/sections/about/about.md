I'm a **front-end engineer with 6 years of experience**, along with a strong background in **User Experience**. I've had the opportunity to work with culturally diverse teams and tech stacks which opened up avenues to projects of varying scales such as WordPress sites, SPAs, Sitecore sites and custom MVC frameworks. As for my education; I graduated with a **Bachelor of Science** in **Computer Systems** and graduated with **distinction** from Heriot-Watt University in Dubai.

Over the course of my professional career I've tacked on numerous skills to my growing list, some of which include: **React, HTML5, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript, wire-framing, QA and User testing.** I also have experience in **front-end development, technical and project management** with a background in **UX**, having worked at **rbbi**; one of the top **UX** agencies in the MENA region.

After working as a hybrid front-end developer/project manager I moved on to work at **dubizzle** team for the **OLX group** based in Dubai. I worked as the sole front end support for the OLX MENA region whose subsites consisted of 8 countries including Egypt, Lebanon and Oman. I was the lead front-end engineer for implementing new features and upgrading existing code that was built on a custom PHP framework. **I also headed the front end for implementing the new initiative for rolling out paid ad subscription services for the first time for OLX MENA users, to boost their ad reach.**

In my most recent role I was contracted by **OMNIA** to work as a front-end consultant with multiple teams and vendors for the **Abu Dhabi Digital Authority(ADDA) in the TAMM project**; a single stop for all government services and journeys for users all over Abu Dhabi. It was here where I had the opportunity to work with large scale teams as a front-end developer to create custom modular components to be integrated in several government Sitecore entity websites with independent themes.
