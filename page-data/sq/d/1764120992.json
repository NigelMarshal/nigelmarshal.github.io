I've had the privilege of collaborating with culturally diverse teams and leveraging a wide range of tech stacks. These opportunities have allowed me to work on an array of projects, from WordPress and Sitecore sites to Single Page Applications and custom MVC frameworks. I graduated with <strong>distinction</strong> from Heriot-Watt University in Dubai, earning a <strong>Bachelor of Science</strong> degree in <strong>Computer Systems</strong>.</p>\n<p>Throughout my career, I've honed numerous skills and expertise in key areas including <strong>React, HTML5, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript, wire-framing, QA, and User testing</strong>. Additionally, I have comprehensive experience in <strong>front-end development, technical, and project management</strong>. I cut my teeth in the world of <strong>UX</strong> at <strong>rbbi</strong>, one of the top UX agencies in the MENA region.</p>\n<p>Following my tenure as a hybrid front-end developer/project manager, I joined the <strong>dubizzle</strong> team for the <strong>OLX group</strong> based in Dubai. Here, I served as the exclusive front-end support for the OLX MENA region, covering eight countries including Egypt, Lebanon, and Oman. I led the implementation of new features and the enhancement of existing code built on a custom PHP framework. A notable achievement during this period was spearheading the rollout of paid ad subscription services for OLX MENA users, significantly boosting their ad reach.</p>\n<p>Most recently, I've been working at <strong>Ajar</strong>, where I've continued to deepen my expertise in <strong>Angular</strong> while contributing to the design and implementation of several key platform features. This has led to significant increases in user engagement and platform efficiency and helped in acquiring high-value clients.</p>\n<p>In between my roles, I spent a year as a freelancer, honing my web development and content writing skills and supporting small businesses in their digital transformation efforts. This period not only helped me grow professionally but also brought me closer to the pulse of the tech industry's dynamic landscape.</p>\n<p>I believe in the power of continuous learning and staying abreast with the latest industry trends. As such, I'm always looking to add new skills and technologies to my toolkit.</p>"}]}}}
